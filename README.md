Welcome to the Opensource ICT Solutions GitHub, where you'll find all kinds of usefull Zabbix resources.

This is script is a script written in Python. The script will allow us to disable or enable hosts wherever we see a dotted line under a hostname in the Zabbix frontend using the Zabbix API. For example a Zabbix user with limited permission could use this script to disable or enable a host right from the Monitoring | Hosts page or even a Zabbix map.
